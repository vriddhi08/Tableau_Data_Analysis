An e-commerce company that has faced some losses recently and they want to manage their inventory very well so as to reduce any unnecessary costs that they might be bearing. In this assignment, you have to manage the inventory cost of this e-commerce company OList. You need to identify top products that contribute to the revenue and also use market basket analysis to analyse the purchase behaviour of individual customers to estimate with relative certainty, what items are more likely to be purchased individually or in combination with some other products.

Data exploration and cleaning: Identify missing and duplicate values in each column and treat them accordingly. Also, treat any and all data quality issues associated with the dataset.
Data visualisation: Create appropriate visualisations to identify the most ordered products by quantity and revenue.
Market basket analysis: Identify combinations of product categories that are ordered frequently and visualise them as required. This can be done by creating a simple matrix with product categories in the rows and columns and then checking which of the pairs show associations.
Dashboarding : Create a neat dashboard containing the important visualisations
